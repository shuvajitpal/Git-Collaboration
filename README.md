# Git & Collaboration  
## What I Built  
This repository contains my Java learning tasks, each uploaded with proper commit history to track my daily progress. For Task 10, I practiced version control using Git and GitHub by pushing all my previous tasks and documenting them clearly.  
## Why I Built It  
The main objective was to gain hands-on experience with Git commands, commit history, and collaboration practices. By uploading tasks one by one with meaningful commit messages, I ensured that my learning journey is traceable and well-documented for future reference or collaboration.  
## How I Built It  
- Created a GitHub repository to store all tasks.  
- Initialized Git in my local project folders.  
- Added files and committed each task separately with clear commit messages.  
- Linked my local repo to GitHub and pushed changes branch by branch.  
- Created a **new branch** to upload task 7, 8 & 9 from a different folder without disturbing the main branch.  
### Tools Used
